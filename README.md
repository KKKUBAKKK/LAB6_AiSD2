In this task, Kazik the chameleon wants to visit his gecko friend Grześ in the city without being noticed by children. To do this, Kazik must navigate the city streets, which are painted in different colors. Kazik can change his color to blend in with the streets, but only in a specific order. The task is to first determine if Kazik can reach Grześ's house without being caught, and then to find the path that requires the least effort, considering both the distance traveled and the difficulty of changing colors.
